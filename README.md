# Horspool-s-algorithm
This is the project we used to find a pattern inside a larger text efficiently â€” faster than basic brute-force methods.
Horspool's algorithm is a string matching algorithm. It's a simplified version of the Boyer-Moore algorithm, optimized for practical use, especially when searching for patterns in large texts.
